# Overview
This was my very first project during the General Assembly Immersive course. Working solo on this project, I had 3 days to come out with a number-guessing game.
In this game, the computer generates a random number and the player has three chances to choose the correct number.The player gains points each time they choose the correct number. 

# Brief
Write a number-guessing game which functions as follows:
Computer generates a random number.
Player should be able to make a guess.
If the player chooses the correct number they win and can play again
If the [player is incorrect then they lose a life. If they lose 3 lives then the game is over.
If you make some good progress, you can add some extra features like making the next level higher if the player wins etc.
